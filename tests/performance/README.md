# Performance Tests

These tests measure how the system behaves under heavy load and prolonged usage.

Suggested scenarios:

- Populate the board with hundreds of tasks and monitor rendering time.
- Simulate rapid drag-and-drop operations to ensure smooth interaction.
- Stress test the task API with concurrent create and update operations.
