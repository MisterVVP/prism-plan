# Integration Tests

These tests ensure that individual services and components work together as expected.

Suggested scenarios:

- Create a task via the API and verify it appears on the board.
- Drag a task between categories and confirm its category persists after a page reload.
- Double-click a task card and check that it is marked as done across the system.
